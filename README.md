## App.py
- Develop a user-friendly GUI application for chatting with the chatbot.
- Customize UI design, including colors, fonts, and layout, to match your preferences.
- Change the bot's name (`bot_name`) to personalize your chatbot's identity.

## Chat.py
- Implement the chatbot's logic, including message processing and responses.
- Load the trained model and customize responses for specific user interactions.

## Model.py
- Customize the neural network model architecture for text classification.
- Adapt the model to your specific chatbot requirements.

## Nltk_utils.py
- Customize text preprocessing by modifying stemming behavior and rules.
- Fine-tune text preprocessing to suit your chatbot's context and language.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pill2x/ChatBot.git`
2. Train the model using `Train.py`, allowing customization of hyperparameters.
3. Run the chat application with `App.py`. Personalize the UI and bot's name.

Feel free to adapt and extend `intents.json`, modify hyperparameters, and customize your chatbot's behavior to align with your unique project goals.
